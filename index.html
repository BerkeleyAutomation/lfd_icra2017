<p>
Motivated by recent advances in Deep Learning for robot control, this paper considers two learning algorithms in terms of how they acquire demonstrations.
 ``Human-Centric" (HC) sampling is the standard supervised learning algorithm, where a human supervisor demonstrates the task by teleoperating the robot
 to provide trajectories consisting of state-control pairs. 
 ``Robot-Centric" (RC) sampling is an increasingly popular alternative used in algorithms such as DAgger, where a human supervisor observes the robot executing a learned 
policy and provides corrective control labels for each state visited.  RC sampling can be challenging for human supervisors and prone to mislabeling. 
 RC sampling can also induce error in policy performance because it repeatedly visits areas of the state space that are harder to learn. 
Although policies learned with RC sampling can be superior to HC sampling for standard learning models such as linear SVMs, policies learned with HC sampling may be comparable with classes of highly-expressive learning models such as deep learning and
 hyper-parametric decision trees, which can achieve very low training error.  We compare HC and RC using a  grid world and a physical robot singulation task where the input is a binary image of a connected set of objects on a planar worksurface and the policy generates 
a motion of the gripper to separate one object from the rest.  We observe in simulation that for linear SVMs, policies learned with RC outperformed those learned with HC but that with deep models this advantage disappears.  
We also find that with RC, the corrective control labels provided by humans can be highly inconsistent. 
 We finally prove that there exists a class of examples where in the limit, HC is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy while RC may fail to converge. 
These results suggest that HC sampling may be preferable for highly-expressive learning models like deep learning for robotic tasks.
